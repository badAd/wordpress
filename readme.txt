== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a badAd.one account? =

Yes. Signup is easy and there are help videos available at the [badAd Help](https://badad.one/help_videos.php) page.

= Will this slow down my WordPress site? =

In short: not as much.

Technically, everything you add to any website will slow it down. But, badAd takes two steps to speed things up:

1. Less is more: We minimize code, files, and things like database calls. We also don't mine information about visitors to your WordPress site. We just deliver the ads, short and simple.

2. badAd uses text ads. These load faster than ads with pictures.

= Do these ads make my website look ugly? =

They shouldn't. Our text ads try their best to inherit the styling of your WordPress theme, so they fit nicely, hopefully having some of the same fonts, etc.

We try to keep things organized and grouped so that badAd ads aren't confused with your WordPress site's content. These ads should still should look like they belong, but without so much distraction.
