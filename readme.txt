== Description ==

The official plugin from badAd.one, this can help monetize your WordPress site by embedding badAd advertisements with shortcodes.

Once connected, you can use two shortcodes:

1. To embed ads for your badAd Partner account
2. To embed a styled referral link for you and others to receive free ad credits, also adding to your Partner click count

All the settings are on one page in your WordPress Dashboard with an easy walk-through.

This plugin is intended for badAd Partners, but it is easy to become one. Once you are a badAd monetizing Partner, this is plugin connects your WordPress site to the badAd "Dev API" mentioned in the <a href="https://badad.one/444/site.html"> help videos</a>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a badAd.one account? =

Yes. Signup is easy and there are help videos available at the [badAd Help](https://badad.one/help_videos.php) page.

= Will this slow down my WordPress site? =

In short: not as much.

Technically, everything you add to any website will slow it down. But, badAd takes two steps to speed things up:

1. Less is more: We minimize code, files, and things like database calls. We also don't mine information about visitors to your WordPress site. We just deliver the ads, short and simple.

2. badAd uses text ads. These load faster than ads with pictures.

= Do these ads make my website look ugly? =

They shouldn't. Our text ads try their best to inherit the styling of your WordPress theme, hopefully having some of the same fonts, etc.

We try to keep things organized and grouped so that badAd ads aren't confused with your WordPress site's content, but still should fit nicely alongside your content.

= Does this work on multisite? = 

No, but multisite (with all the juicy options) is coming if the product becomes popular.

You can use the normal "Embed Code" (without this plugin) from the badAd Partner Center just fine on multisite.
